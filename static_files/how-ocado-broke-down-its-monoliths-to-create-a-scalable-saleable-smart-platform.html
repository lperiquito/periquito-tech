<h1 itemprop="name" class="article-title">How Ocado broke down its monoliths to create a scalable, saleable Smart Platform</h1>
<h2 class="article-sub-title">Ocado wrote most of its own software and
intends to sell it to other retailers - but the original monolithic
architecture had to be torn down first</h2>
<p dir="ltr">With 645,000 customers, 49,000 products and three distribution centres (for now - <a href="https://www.computing.co.uk/ctg/interview/3022675/cio-interview-paul-clarke-cio-ocado" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">it is building a fourth</a>), Ocado is the world's largest online grocer. However, even this disruptive firm has legacy technology.</p>
<p dir="ltr">"Even though we're a grocery retailer on the front of it,
we're not your typical retail enterprise," said software engineering
team lead Matthew Cornford, at Computing's <a href="http://events.computing.co.uk/devops/static/home" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">DevOps Summit</a>. "Behind the scenes there's a vast array of technology powering our retail business...</p>
<div id="rdm-above-related"></div>
<p dir="ltr">"We've learnt that just picking software off the shelf
isn't sufficient for our real-world problems and our complex needs. To
address these problems, we've had to build up competencies in-house."</p>
<p dir="ltr">Infrastructure team lead Luis Periquito said, "We had a
very central typical enterprise solution, where if we want to grow
things we just add more: we have central databases and if they run out
of grunt, we add more CPUs and more RAM."</p>
<p dir="ltr">He continued, "As we have these massive monoliths, we force
 everything running on those machines to be exactly the same. Every
single development team, every single application will have to work the
same way [and] on the same environment."</p>
<p dir="ltr">This monolithic environment brought many challenges to
Ocado, which Cornford summarised as competition; painful deployment; and
 narrow focus.</p>
<p dir="ltr">Competition: "In a warehouse the size of ours, there are
multiple projects going on, and these were assigned project managers,
whose role it was to ensure that the technology part of the project was
delivered on-time... The developers weren't equipped to know which
projects were the most important - which was going to have the most
valuable impact. What often happened was that the IT project manager who
 could shout the loudest would get their work done first."</p>
<p dir="ltr">Painful deployment: "If I wanted to deliver a monolithic
application, that means downtime... and reduces the throughput and
efficiency of our warehouse... Luckily there was a natural downtime window
 at the end of the day, and all of our deployments had to be done in
this time.</p>
<p dir="ltr">"We also had quite a lengthy approval process to go
through. To get a deployment done we had to sign a form; chase a manager
 to sign it off; find someone in Operations to action our deployment;
and this was all at the end of the day when everyone either wants to go
home, or has already gone home...</p>
<p dir="ltr">"Add to that the fact that our code wouldn't actually start
 running until six or seven in the evening, so if something did go wrong
 that inevitably meant the developer on call would get called in the
early evening - if they were lucky - or more likely in the middle of the
 night to sort out a problem."</p>
<p dir="ltr">Narrow focus: "Our production environments were imposed on
us by the infrastructure team. This led to teams that were quite narrow
in focus and specialised... The problem with this is when something goes
wrong, you need everyone to sort it out because no-one has the big
picture. I remember a few support calls with tens of people where
everyone was just trying to figure out if the fault lay in their area.
That tendency can lead to stress, conflict and mistrust between teams."</p>

<h4 dir="ltr">Breaking down the monoliths</h4>
<p dir="ltr">"Our current challenge is to create <a href="https://www.computing.co.uk/ctg/feature/3019162/will-ocados-robotics-change-the-supermarket-trade" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">a warehouse system that can power the world's largest retailers</a>
 - so we couldn't use monoliths any more," said Periquito. "It's very
hard to create monoliths; it's very hard to replicate... and they're very
 expensive to start with... Instead, we had to use models: buildable parts
that we could grow as and when we need. If we need to pack more items,
we add more bots.</p>
<p dir="ltr">"[In the new system] we have all these moving parts, so
scale out naturally became very important. If we want to add more
resources, we add more resources - we don't try to grow the resources we
 have. That means we can expend capital if and when we need to;
hopefully we don't have such a huge capital expense at the building."</p>
<div id="rdm-above-related"></div>
<p dir="ltr">Cornford added, "The monoliths are mostly gone, and we've
moved to a more service-based architecture; something that's
horizontally scalable and expects underlying infrastructure to fail.
This is great because it means that our applications are more reliable
in the face of actual hardware failures, and in the face of planned
failure, like deployments and upgrades... It means we can do these things
more often."</p>
<p dir="ltr">Ocado took its first steps to becoming a technology supplier <a href="https://www.computing.co.uk/ctg/news/3022125/ocado-signs-technology-deal-with-frances-groupe-casino-supermarket" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">late last year</a>, and it intends to <a href="https://www.computing.co.uk/ctg/news/3024924/ocado-signs-deal-with-canadian-supermarket-group-for-its-ocado-smart-platform" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">continue this expansion</a>
 - aiming at what Periquito called "the infrastructure Holy Grail":
starting from a completely powered-off server room and warehouse, but
able to automatically turn everything on, deploying infrastructure and
applications and configuring the network without anyone touching it -
anywhere in the world.</p>
<p dir="ltr">"This," he admits, "is a really big challenge."</p>
